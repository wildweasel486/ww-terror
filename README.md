Weasel Presents: Terrorists! (Police Brutality)

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE

1. Click "Download Zip."
2. Extract that somewhere. Now you have a folder full of the development files. Don't panic, we'll put that together really easy.
3. Run the "_zip.bat" file from where you extracted everything. Tell it whether you want a pk3 or a pk7. The difference is negligible, honestly.
4. The result: you now have a ww-terror.pk3 file that can be run with ZDoom or GZDoom. (Just make sure you're running a development build, because I think it might break in the stable releases.)

## ALTERNATIVELY

- Download it from itch.io here: https://wildweasel.itch.io/terrorists
- Or from the Releases tab if you're that way.
